# great-quotes-base

In order to learn programming and develop skills I have
written several projects. One of them is located here:
https://great-quotes-base.herokuapp.com/
This is a website that serves as a database of quotes. The
application allows you to set up an account and login. Adding
a quote to the database requires logging in. An unlogged user
can browse the website and search for quotes by the author.
Users with administrator status can delete and edit quotes. All
data is stored in a remote MySQL database.
Technologies used in the project: Java, Spring Boot, Spring
Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf + HTML,
Maven, Remote MySQL.

Login details for the administrator account for the test: Login: Admin1234 Password: Admin1234
